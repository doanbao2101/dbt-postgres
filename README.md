# 🛠️ dbt Postgres Analytics Warehouse

A **dbt** repository for transforming and modeling data in a **Postgres** data warehouse. This project includes modular, tested **SQL models**, **sources**, and comprehensive **documentation** for efficient analytics engineering and maintaining high **data quality**.

## 📊 Features
- **Modular SQL Models**: Easily extendable and reusable models for data transformation.
- **Tested Data**: Built-in tests to ensure high-quality, reliable data.
- **Sources**: Clear definition of sources for tracking raw data from various tables.
- **Documentation**: Well-documented models and source definitions for easy maintenance and collaboration.
- **Data Quality**: Data integrity is prioritized with automated checks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧑‍💻 Prerequisites
1. **PostgreSQL**: Ensure you have a running PostgreSQL instance for this project.
2. **dbt**: Install dbt core and the `dbt-postgres` adapter for PostgreSQL.
   ```bash
   pip install dbt-core==1.9.6 dbt-postgres

### 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dbt-postgres.git
   cd dbt-postgres
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   dbt deps
   ```

3. Configure your **profiles.yml** file (located in `~/.dbt/`) to connect to your PostgreSQL database:

   ```yaml
   default:
     target: dev
     outputs:
       dev:
         type: postgres
         host: your-db-host
         user: your-db-user
         password: your-db-password
         dbname: your-db-name
         schema: your-schema
         threads: 4
   ```

### 🏃‍♀️ Running the Models

Once your environment is set up, run the dbt models:

```bash
dbt run
```

### 🧪 Running Tests

To test your models for data quality:

```bash
dbt test
```

### 📄 Documentation

Generate the project documentation:

```bash
dbt docs generate
```

Serve the docs locally:

```bash
dbt docs serve
```
